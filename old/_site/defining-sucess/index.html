        <p>Whether it be academics or athletics or something else, I and many others (or so I believe) have the goal of being &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;successful&#8217;. As I am about to embark on a career of science, I have increasingly thought about what that means. Is it well-defined? Is there an objective measure? Or, is it inherently subjective? Does that affect my opportunity to get better?</p>

<p>Thinking about the past, I seem to have been drawn to objective measures of success. For example, I have been a <a href='/trial-of-miles-miles-of-trials'>competitive runner</a> for seven years now. The goal there is extremely simple: for a certain distance, minimize the time it takes to run it. One of the best parts of that is that I don&#8217;t have to expend effort in evaluating how good I am. Well, I have to race. But, once the race is done, I have a pretty straightforward conception of how I am doing. Plus, with workouts and training, I can tell whether I am improving on my goal or not.</p>

<p>As a computer scientist, I implicitly think about this using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a field of machine learning where agents act in an environment and try to maximize some type of reward. Reinforcement learning became popular in the public when Google DeepMind&#8217;s <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961'>AlphaGo defeated Go world champion Lee Sodol</a>. Reinforcement learning was the workhorse behind DeepMind&#8217;s success. Here, the objective was to win games and the game engine had to explore strategies in order to optimize the probability it won.</p>

<p>Back to the running scenario, my reward function is the time it takes to run a race. The faster I am, the higher my reward. Given that I know this reward function, I can do research and tailor my strategy to increase my reward. That is, to be successful, I just need to get faster and there are canonical ways to do so.</p>

<p>In middle school, I wanted to be good at math. I unfortunately, however, assumed the wrong reward function: math competitions. While I was decently good at them, I <a href='/rethinking-secondary-mathematics-education'>struggled in the classroom</a>. The reason being was that I spent my time memorizing all these shortcuts and tricks rather than gain some deep understanding of the mathematical concepts. So, while my goal was to get better at math, the fact that I assumed the wrong reward function and optimized for that means I didn&#8217;t get to the math level I wanted to.</p>

<p>In the present-day, I do have a better understanding of what it means to be good at math. For example, I know I am much better at proofs and abstraction. But, that is extremely hand-wavey (at least to me). I don&#8217;t have an objective measure for that. Furthermore, while I have a rough understanding of what it takes to to be better, I don&#8217;t have a good definition of the reward function. Thus, while I can get better at math by contributing X hours a day towards it, I probably won&#8217;t be getting better optimally. There is certainly a fear of being inefficient. I want to be able to use the reward function to really understand my strengths and weaknesses so I can create a better strategy.</p>

<p>The same uncertainty is happening with my future at a scientist. I need to have a lot of knowledge of the field, but it also requires ability to design experiments, originality, communication, etc. Certain &#8216;objective&#8217; measures have been proposed to measure how good of a scientist someone is. In academia, many of these revolve around citation counts (obviously for industry scientists it is different unless they are constantly publishing).</p>

<p>Yet, now we get into the problem of Goodhart&#8217;s Law. It has been paraphrased as &#8220;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&#8221; Citation or publication counts can be a good heuristic when someone is not trying to optimize those numbers. But doing can lead to ongoing replication crisis in science where scientists are publishing results of effects that are not actually there. Rather, they employ questionable scientific practices to increase the probability of one statistically significant hypothesis.</p>

<p>Think about the great scientists. Galileo, Darwin, Newton, Einstein. Imagine if they were worried about Google Scholar citation counts. They took time to develop highly original and predictive theories that accurately explain reality today. That is science. Yet, many scientists rightfully ask whether someone like Darwin would get a job in academia today? Scientific institutions have defined the reward function in science to be a function of citations and publications, and perhaps the overemphasis of that reward function means science like the greats did won&#8217;t be carried out. Einstein is certainly a highly-cited author, but he is not a top twenty cited scholar in all of physics. It is useful to measure his impact by citation count because he (presumably) was not trying to maximize it. But, as Goodhart&#8217;s Law states, once citation counts becomes a measure of how good a scientist one is, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>

<p>Another way to think of scientific greatness is via Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>. Kuhn is the philosopher of science that popularized the phrase &#8216;paradigm shift&#8217;. He separates science into two distinctions: normal science and revolutionary science. Normal science operates under a paradigm, which is when there is an overarching theory and specific definitions of terminology. This theory makes predictions and scientists are tasked with creating experiments that prove or disprove the theory&#8217;s hypothesis. Revolutionary science is when paradigms change. It seems from Kuhn&#8217;s distinction that the great scientists we have are ones who created new paradigms and brought about revolutionary science.</p>

<p>The question this brings up is whether the goal of a scientist is to be successful in normal science or bring about a paradigm shift? And, actually, the question is whether those two goals have similar strategies or different strategies? The strategy for success in normal science is straightforward: under the theory, generate hypothesis and conduct experiments confirming or disconfirming the theory. Is doing this how scientists get disillusioned with a current paradigm and create a new one? That is, are the scientists that bring about new paradigms masters of the old one and the best &#8216;normal scientists&#8217; becomes the &#8216;revolutionary scientists&#8217;?</p>

<p>One reason to think this is not true is what oftentimes there is not experimental evidence to support new revolutionary paradigms in the early stages. Rather, it is often held as a dogmatic belief by a few individuals. While history of science taught in layman&#8217;s terms seems to point that new theories were always better predictors than old theories, it is not usually the case. Copernicus&#8217;s heliocentric theory only matched the experimental evidence of Ptolemy&#8217;s geocentric theory more than half a century after Copernicus&#8217;s death. Yet, we praise Copernicus despite the fact he believed in the less experimentally validated theory since it eventually replaced Ptolemy&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Look at the paradigm shift in artificial intelligence today when deep learning took over. Neural nets were invented a while ago, but they became out of fashion for a while. Yet, it was the <a href='https://torontolife.com/tech/ai-superstars-google-facebook-apple-studied-guy/'>stubbornness of Geoff Hinton</a> that led to the advent of the current state of machine learning we see today. Today, we praise Hinton for sticking to his beliefs in the face of pressure to abandon his research. We praise Copernicus for championing the heliocentric theory. And, we praise Lavoisier for replacing phlogiston. Yet, all these scientists had these beliefs when it was seemingly irrational to have them. Thus, there seems to be a degree of irrationality, stubbornness, and close-mindedness it takes to be a great scientist. But before we champion these ideals in scientists, how many scientists had these traits, thought they would be great scientists, and then be proven wrong?</p>

<p>Perhaps the path for success for revolutionary scientists and normal scientists are in fact different. And, perhaps one is inherently riskier than the other. That risk may lead to a small chance that your name will be in textbooks for generations to come or the much (larger) chance that your theories will be dismissed as hearsay.</p>

<p>We can turn to philosophy as well to examine the greats there. The great philosophers did not have bulletproof logic. Otherwise, their arguments would be for the most part accepted today. Descartes <em>cogito ergo sum</em> is influential, but his justification is generally considered inadequate. There are very few dualists in philosophy of mind today. By contemporary standards, Kant&#8217;s arguments would be awful. But, he is considered a great because he changed the way we did philosophy. He gave a new perspective.</p>

<p>In philosophy, like science, we are taught that incremental is good. Yet, being incremental is not how you contribute the most to your field. That is done by being incredibly original. So again we have the question of whether being incremental for some time is necessary for being revolutionary? If not, why do we teach philosophy to be incremental? Some may say yes - it is only after grappling with concepts for years that we are truly able to understand the flaws and generate new ideas and theories. Others might take a more rationalist approach - we are not going to pay attention to the person who generates all these crazy ideas even if it is probable that one of things (unknown to us, though) is influential. Rather, we listen to the person who is trained in the same we are but eventually strays off the path and stakes their reputation on their new ideas.</p>

<p>If this essay has established anything, it is that I have no idea what it means to be good. Or rather, I can&#8217;t give a precise characterization that lets me optimize my contributions to the field. Perhaps that&#8217;s a good thing. Whenever there is a precise characterization, it oftentimes deviates a little from our intuitive notion of success and we don&#8217;t realize that until we overoptimize the function (and hence become subject to Goodhart&#8217;s Law). While we don&#8217;t have the best metrics for knowing who are the best scientists today, maybe the pursuit of that is ill-fated. We have a general idea of what separates bad science from good science and bad philosophy from good philosophy. Yes we will make mistakes, both by considering bad science to be good science and vice versa. We will probably discover some greats&#8217; works after they die. But this has probably always been the case, from the time of Aristotle to present-day.</p>

<p>That being said, it is important to keep on having this conversation so that we are getting better in how we evaluate and making sure we eradicate biases in the system.</p>
<hr />
<p> I should note that this need not be every runner&#8217;s goal. Something I often see at the collegiate level is that people want to win championships. While this is seemingly similar to my goal, there are slight differences. For example, championship races are often slow because the runners jog for a long time and then have a sprint finish. To be successful in that endeavor requires a lot more sprint speed than needed in my goal. Of course one must be very fast in order to just get to the championship level and there is an overlap between runners who set records and runners who win championships, but I have selectively focused on one.</p>
