When someone talks about "zen", the last thing you think about is college football. Especially good ole' SEC football. But, there is an interesting life philosophy that connects the Zen master and ancient Greeks to the California mountain climbers and Alabama football players.

Yvon Chouninard, avid climber and founder of the Patagonia clothing company, writes in his memoir, *Let My People Go Surfing*, that he has

> been a student of Zen philosophy of many years. In Zen archery, for example, you forget about the goal - hitting the bull's eye - and instead focus on all the individual movements involved in shooting an arrow. You practice your stance, reaching back and smoothly pulling an arrow out of the quiver, notching it on the string, controlling your breathing, and letting the arrow release itself. If you've perfected all the elements, you can't help but hit the center of the target. The same philosophy is true for climbing mountains. If you focus on the *process* of climbing, you'll end up on the summit.

For college football fans, this concept of focusing on the *process* may seem all too familiar. Nick Saban, legendary coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide, has made it a trademark of his coaching philosophy ever since being introduced to the concept by a Michigan State psychology professor. 

Essentially, the input is what matters. It is the only thing you can control. Focus on doing your role, step by step, and the rest will fall into place.

Monte Burke explains in his biography, *Saban: The Making of a Coach*, that "Saban constantly admonished his players not to think about lifting a trophy at the end of the season, but focus on conditioning, reps in practice, and on keeping their grades up to remain eligible to play."

A [SEC Sports article](http://www.secsports.com/article/14561357/nick-saban-process) states that

> The Process is simply Saban's core belief that the willingness to prepare in a methodical, daily basis is the key to success. Saban believes those who focus on the result and not the consistent preparation that is necessary to achieve the result are doomed to be disappointed.

> "It's about committing yourself to being the best you can be on that particular day," said Saban. "Improvement is a steady march and you have to be committed to it."

Ryan Holiday drew parallels between 'the Process' and Stoic philosophy in his book, *The Obstacle is the Way*.[^1] Stoicism advocates for not letting the results of actions dictate your feelings. Results are products of your inputs as well as some other, uncontrollable inputs. If these uncontrollable inputs go against you, failure is not necessarily your fault. Thus, if you are doing the best to your ability and still fail, so be it. There is a degree of luck involved in the success of every venture, and one must obey the laws of probability.[^2]

Until I read Chouinard's memoir, I thought 'the Process' was a relatively obscure and isolated idea. The fact that it is a part of Zen philosophy and mountain climbing culture, in addition to SEC football and Stoicism, just might point to the range and importance of the concept. It is an effective and successful philosophy that can and should be used by anyone with a goal.

A common criticism I hear of American philosophy departments is that they only emphasize Western philosophy. It would be interesting learning more about Eastern philosophies or more obscure Western philosophies (e.g. Stoicism) to learn about new ideas and potential parallels. It may even increase the popularity of philosophy.[^3]

[^1]: Stoicism is often misrepresented as showing no emotion and having no feeling. It is much more complex than this.

[^2]: Referencing probability while explaining a philosophy is what happens when you read too much Eliezer Yudkowsky.

[^3]: I don't mind philosophy being considered impractical, but I'm also a philosophy minor. That being said, the ratio of computer science to philosophy majors at my school is 16:1, and I go to a liberal arts college.
