While reading a contemporary philosophy critique, I came across a man named Al-Azm. I was immediately taken aback. I had never seen such a name while reading a philosophical text before. A quick Google search showed that Al-Azm was not some ancient Islamic scholar but rather is a Yale-educated philosopher specializing in the work of Immanuel Kant. 

However, the seed in my head was set. I quipped in a [previous footnote](/from-china-to-tusaloosa) of mine that a critique I hear about academic philosophy is how Western dominated it is. Eurocentrism is not a new concept. Everyone who has taken a high school history class has heard of it. But philosophers, who pride themselves on rational analysis, should embrace new forms of knowledge. We hope that philosophers are the first removed from irrational biases, though this is clearly not the case as the field remains [incredibly male-dominated](http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/06/17/192523112/name-ten-women-in-philosophy-bet-you-can-t).

In primary and secondary school, we learn about Confucius and Buddha. They seem relatively on par with figures like Aristotle and Descartes. I learned briefly about the Golden Age of Islam just like I did with the Middle Ages. 

In academic philosophy curricula, however, there is no comparison. There are courses just analyzing Plato or Kant or Nietzsche. On the other hand, they will only have a 'Buddhist Philosophy' class if their department is large enough.

Let's take Oxford's [lecture list](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/philosophy/documents/media/Lecture_scheme_2016-17_2_Sept.pdf) for the past year as an example. They planned 102 courses, none of which have an Eastern bent. Now, there ended up being an 'Indian Philosophy' course this term and a 'Buddhist Philosophy' course last year, and I suspect the addition of these were not planned but rather the department saw that they had the availability to offer a class. Note also that these two courses are considered special graduate classes and that none of the undergraduate curriculum offers any such courses.

Thus, there were two courses (of over a hundred) in the past year explicitly discussing Eastern philosophy. Many of the courses are not necessarily focused on Western figures but rather general themes like "Philosophy of Science". However, I'm sure that everyone would agree that the curriculum of such classes solely consists of Western philosophers. In fact, this is not necessarily surprising as it might turn out that the Philosophy of Science is a purely Western discipline anyways (though I highly doubt it).

It is a chicken-and-egg problem. If philosophers get educated in the Western tradition, then they will specialize and write about Western concepts. They aren't going to start offering Eastern courses because there is not enough faculty to do so. I don't think undergraduates would care a lot more about taking Western philosophy classes rather than Eastern. I genuinely believe they would be interested in taking both because almost all of the material they learn will be new to them.

For lack of a better term, should we then have affirmative action for Eastern philosophy? I suspect that most philosophers realize that the field is inherently Eurocentric. However, there is very little incentive to study "fringe" philosophers (in academia) such as Confucius or an Islamic scholar. Their translations might not be as good as the modern Europeans. There is significantly less contemporary literature about them. And, the community is a lot smaller. One has to essentially build Eastern Philosophy from the ground-up, and it is a huge endeavor with little personal payoff.

However, for a field that prides itself on the love of knowledge, surely philosophy as a whole should embrace, or at least consider, Eastern ideas. Thus, there should be some incentive to bring more Eastern ideas to fruition. It seems such an initiative must happen from universities in order to trump academia politics.

Some may argue that Eastern philosophy follows a significantly different tradition than Western. So what? Philosophy is known as the great debate, and what tradition to follow is definitely fair game to debate. Within Western philosophy, there is the analytical and continental divide. People seem fine with that distinction. Both of those traditions have contributed enormously to the field. Introducing a new way to do philosophy has the potential for huge impact. Great philosophers are those who bring something new to the table. By introducing thinkers from other cultures, one is doing exactly that.

Others argue that some parts of Eastern philosophy may be too intertwined with religions, for example Islam and Buddhism. The above rebuttal still stands that a different way to do philosophy is insufficient to render it useless. But, more importantly, there is not such a separation between many great Western philosophers and religion. Aquinas, Descartes, and Spinoza each have their own lecture series at Oxford and all three of them were incredibly religious in their philosophy.  

A high-risk but high-reward venture may be investigating Eastern philosophers for different interpretations of Western philosophies. What if there are other philosophers who developed Kantian philosophies independently? We could use their variations to create new schools of thought and perhaps gain better insights into how to evaluate Kant. Quick Wikipedia searches show that the 12th-century Islamic scholar, Averroes, provided commentaries on Aristotle which eventually influenced Aquinas and is the reason Aristotle is considered a great today. Multiple nineteenth century philosophers noted similarities between Spinoza and the Vedanta school of Indian philosophy. Today's philosophers might not want to make the gamble of only doing Eastern philosophy. But, if there are certain philosophies that provide insights into the Western philosophers they study, it could lead to major a great deal of progress in the field. 

It would be unfair of me to end this post without talking about potential personal conflicts of interest. While I would like to have my argument being as unbiased as possible, I focused on Arabic, Indian, and Chinese philosophies above and my origins are from that area. Despite the little I know about those philosophies, I know even less (i.e. nothing) about African or South American ones and did not reference them. This post was inspired by me reading an Arabic name, but it is unclear whether I would have had the same inspiration with an African name. I do my best to avoid personal biases in my posts, but I reckon it was an important part of this one.

Ideological diversity is something I believe almost everyone can accept. For example, I think most Americans would support the idea of bipartisanship. Philosophy is a field which loves knowledge and debates various viewpoints. Shouldn't it be one of the first fields, then, to actively seek new insights? Unfortunately, it is not so straightforward to do so and will require the intervention of some university or organization. After all, philosophy is a human endeavor and thus subject to irrational political influences.
