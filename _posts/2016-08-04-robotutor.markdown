RoboTutor is a project at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute aiming to enable students ages 7 - 10 with basic arithmetic, reading, and writing skills. This project is the university's entry into the Global Learning XPRIZE Competition, which is aiming to solve the shortage of teachers in developing countries through open-source technology. I designed and implemented the tutor for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In addition, I designed the persona of the tutor that will act as a motivational agent to the student throughout the learning process.
