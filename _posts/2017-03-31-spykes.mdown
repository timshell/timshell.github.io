description: Spykes is a data analysis and visualization library for neural spike trains.

---
Spykes is a project I'm working alongside the [Kording Lab](http://kordinglab.com) at Northwestern University. We aim to provide researchers a library that makes analysis and visualization of neural spike trains easy and reproducible.


For more information, check out the [github repo](https://github.com/KordingLab/spykes) or the [documentation page](http://kordinglab.com/spykes/).
