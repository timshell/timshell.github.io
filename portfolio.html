    <!-- About -->
    <h2>overview</h2>

    <p>I have spent the last nine years working at the interface of science, technology, and business. I have led transformative projects as a university researcher, applied AI to commercial (biotechnology) and nonprofit (education) domains, and worked with venture capitalists to analyze and map out industry trends.
    <br><br>
    In lieu (or rather in addition to) a <a href="https://mayank-agrawal.com/MayankAgrawalResume.pdf">resume</a> or <a href="https://mayank-agrawal.com/MayankAgrawalCV.pdf">academic cv</a>, below highlights what I can bring to an organization.</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>world-class research expertise (machine learning, behavioral science, cognitive neuroscience)</li>
      <li>analytical + data-driven</li>
      <li>extremely collaborative; team player</li>
      <li>high agency</li>
      <li>excellent communication (writing + presentation) skills</li>
      <li>ability to manage/facilitate cross-functional projects/teams</li>
      <li>long-term mindset paired with high pragmatism and focus on execution</li>
      <li>storytelling</li>
      <li>integrity, honesty, loyalty</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>academic research</h2>

      In academic research settings, your objective/product is to write high-impact research papers. I am finishing up my PhD at Princeton University, where I created two influential programs. 

    <h4>Explainable AI for Human Decision-Making</h4>

      Our research (published in <a href="https://mayank-agrawal.com/papers/PetersonBourginAgrawalReichmanGriffiths21.pdf">Science</a> and <a href="https://mayank-agrawal.com/papers/AgrawalPetersonGriffiths20.pdf">PNAS</a>) shows how to (a) build state-of-the-art machine learning models of human behavior and (b) probe these models to identify precise and actionable insights.
      <br><br>
      Sample Implications:
      <ul>
        <li>Let's build an AI that can predict cancer diagnoses better than a doctor. But, we won't stop there. Then, we 'do science' on these models so that we can identify what the AI is picking up on that the doctor is missing. The doctor can now (i) improve his/her/their own skills and (ii) increase their trust in the AI to make diagnostic decisions.
        <br><br>
        <li>Playing an athlete is predictive of wins, but analysts can't understand why. Our work helps the analyst understand what the model is identifying. Perhaps it reflects a complicated function of their basic stats, or perhaps it reflects some 'intangibles' (e.g. a good teammate) which we can reverse-engineer.
      </ul>

    <h4>Neuroscience of Cognitive Fatigue + Boredom</h4>

      Why do we feel tired or bored after working? Our research published in <a href="https://mayank-agrawal.com/papers/AgrawalMattarCohenDaw21.pdf">Psychological Review</a> offers a new, rational perspective on why (and when) resting is beneficial. The general idea is that your brain is actually very active at 'rest'. Specifically, hippocampal replay is a brain function that integrates recent memories with your general decision-making system. We can compute the value of this integration process and compare/contrast it with the value of the current task to identify whether it is rational to work or rest at any time point.

      <br><br>
      Sample Implications:
      <ul>
        <li>What types of rest are actually restorative? Watching TV may be leisurely, but one often doesn't feel rejuvenated afterwards. Contrast this with walking, which is often rejuvenating and able to facilitate creative insights.
        <br><br>
        <li>Can we enhance the restorative process by stimulating the neural mechanisms responsible for recovery? This would allow us to rest more quickly and efficiently. Can we extend similar ideas to sleep? 
      </ul>

    <h2>other</h2>

    <h4>Athletics</h4>

    As a sophomore in high school, I couldn't run a mile. I started training every day. Because my school didn't have a track / cross country team, my friend and I found a group of 40-year-old marathon dads that let us train with them. I walked onto my college team and ended up running a 31:57 10K (6+ miles, 5:08 / per mile), becoming a top-5 10K runner in school history.

    <h4>Venture Capital + Startups</h4>

    I taught the partners at <a href="https://mercuryfund.com/">Mercury Fund</a> the basics of data science and created a visual landscape of the AI + life sciences ecosystem. My work motivated them to incubate a date science consulting company available to portfolio and non-portfolio companies.
    <br><br>
    I have now started to advice startups in the med-tech space due to my work in Explainable AI (see above) space.

    <h4>Educational AI</h4>

    I worked with a research team at Carnegie Mellon to build an educational AI for Tanzanian students. We were one of five finalists in the Global Learning XPRIZE competition, winning $1 million.

    <h4>Computational Biology</h4>

    Can we simulate the protein development pipeline using AI? I did this at <a href="https://kallyope.com/">Kallyope</a> and applied my pipeline to their proprietary genomic sequencing data in order to predict novel hormones the body may be producing.

    <h2>what i am looking for</h2>

    I defend my PhD from Princeton in Summer 2023. I am looking to work in a senior analytics or operations role with driven, highly-motivated teammates. I am prioritizing mission/impact, organizational culture, and compensation. Please reach out at mayank (dot) agrawal (at) princeton (dot) edu. I am more than happy to provide references from my prior supervisors/colleagues.
