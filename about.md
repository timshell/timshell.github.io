In the Fall, I will be starting a PhD at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu/) under the supervision of [Jon Cohen](https://webapps.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/JDC/JDC/Home_Page.html).

Previously, I was an undergraduate at [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/), where I studied computer science and philosophy. I wrote a thesis under [Alan Baker](https://www.swarthmore.edu/profile/alan-baker) using computational learning theory to tackle problems in moral epistemology. I also ran for the [Cross Country](http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/index.aspx?path=mcross) and [Track & Field](http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/index.aspx?path=mtrack) teams.

I have worked at [Kallyope](https://www.kallyope.com/), the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), [Mercury Fund](https://www.mercuryfund.com/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), and [Breakthrough Houston](http://breakthroughhouston.org/).

For a more formal overview, my CV is [here](/assets/docs/cvAgrawal.pdf).
