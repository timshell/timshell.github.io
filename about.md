I'm usually an undergraduate student at [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/), but I'm currently spending the 2016 - 2017 academic year abroad at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). I study computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. 


Outside of the classroom I am a [competitive distance runner](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/4985618.html), an [avid reader](/books), and an obnoxious Texan.
