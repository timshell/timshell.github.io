I'm currently an undergraduate student in [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/)'s Class of 2018. I previously spent the 2016 - 2017 academic year abroad at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). I study computer science, philosophy, and mathematics. 

Outside of the classroom I am a [competitive distance runner](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/4985618.html), an [avid reader](/books), and an obnoxious Texan.

For a more formal overview, my CV is [here](/assets/docs/cvAgrawal.pdf).
