I'm usually an undergraduate student at [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/), but I'm currently spending the 2016 - 2017 academic year abroad at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). I study computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. 

Broadly speaking, I am on the quest to 'solve' intelligence. The computer scientist and mathematician try to find efficient, systematic ways to create inferences from data. This requires a hybrid approach of both theory and practice. The philosopher asks what intelligence even is. To shed light, we must understand the sufficient or necessary conditions for an agent to be considered intelligent.

Another important field in this quest is neuroscience. I spent a summer working at the [Aguirre Lab](https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/) getting a better understanding of computational neuroscience and psychology. While it is unclear whether an artificial intelligence will require reverse-engineering the brain, I believe their models give us a better framework to understand it.

Besides artificial intelligence, I am interested in human intelligence. I previously spent a lot of time with [Breakthrough Houston](http://breakthroughhouston.org/), and it remains perhaps the biggest influence on me to this day. Additionally, I worked on a project called [RoboTutor](/robotutor) to create an artificially intelligent teacher. Besides the social impact of working in the education sector, teaching students can give us insights on how to train artificial agents (and vice versa). I also spent a fair amount of time optimizing my work process so I can maximize my own output. 

Outside of the classroom I am a [competitive distance runner](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/4985618.html), an [avid reader](/books), and an obnoxious Texan.
