        <p>In middle school, I thought I was good at math. I heavily participated in math competitions and was decent at the state level. Those who didn&#8217;t compete would consider me to be smart because I could quickly answer advanced questions.</p>

<p>Yet, I received C&#8217;s and D&#8217;s in my algebra class. What caused this disconnect between class and competitions?</p>

<p>In competitions, I trained to think a specific way. I learned all the tricks of the trade and essentially memorized formulas without understanding any of the logic behind them. After tons of repetitive practice, these formulas became second nature to me. To this day, I can still tell you the square of any number from one to forty. Or, I can tell you how to calculate the area of any regular polygon given its side length. It may seem impressive at first, but in the end it&#8217;s equivalent to memorizing the roster of an NBA team.</p>

<p>My memorization of formulas doesn&#8217;t constitute intelligence and that was reflected in my algebra class. That is, I didn&#8217;t know how to actually <em>think</em>. If I didn&#8217;t recognize a problem as the same type of problem I had done a hundred times already, I froze. I wouldn&#8217;t know how to advance. I could not make connections without them being handed to me. Hence the straight C&#8217;s and D&#8217;s as well as getting the lowest grade in the 20+ year <em>history</em> of my 8th grade math class.</p>

<p>Thankfully, in high school, this got better. I put in extra effort to understand intuitions behind concepts. I wasn&#8217;t focused on memorizing formulas but rather how to use their implications as steps in complex problems. But, I hadn&#8217;t completely transformed. My joy still came from solving problems I knew I could get the answer to by following a systematic set of steps. Give me something using Bayes&#8217; formula and I&#8217;d be the first one to solve it. But give me some abstract formula to prove, and I&#8217;d be stuck.</p>

<p>Once I reached college, this started to really become an issue. In my first semester, I enrolled in a twelve person math seminar class where all we did was prove abstract theorems. There was not a single computation in the class. It was about learning how to develop, write, and verbally present rigorous proofs. That class tore me down.</p>

<p>But, it also built me back up. It has been the hardest, yet most rewarding and memorable class I have taken to this day.</p>

<p>I came away with a deep appreciation of what mathematics is really about. I now look forward to proof-based classes because they allow me to grapple with a finite set of axioms in order to reach some conclusion. It requires painstaking hours of deep thinking and is not something that can be rushed at the last minute. Though not as simple as plugging numbers in and getting the desired outcome, it is extremely more gratifying in the long run.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> I&#8217;m actually <em>thinking</em>.</p>

<p>Math is often critiqued for not being useful after school. Besides simple calculations with money, we don&#8217;t seem to use it often enough to have justified twelve years of study. I mean, is integration by parts really that useful to those who don&#8217;t go into a technical field? Did I really need to get assigned multiple problems of that nature every day for multiple weeks? No, probably not.</p>

<p>Barring those who take intermediate or advanced math courses in college, most people believe math is about numbers and computation. But that&#8217;s not really true. One way to define the subject is that it is about creating a set of rules and trying to figure out what logically follows.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></p>

<p>High school math education needs to divorce itself from mere number crunching. It should focus on thinking abstractly and giving rigorous proofs. That is, develop the ability to use logic to manipulate your given assumptions. This is what math is about, and it&#8217;s easy to see why it&#8217;s more useful as well. If you are able to produce bulletproof logical arguments, you will succeed in fields from physics to English to law.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that computation is important. If you can&#8217;t reliably calculate derivatives, how do you expect to manipulate them in proofs? Computation seems like a necessary condition for critical thinking in math. And if it&#8217;s necessary, surely that justifies the emphasis placed on it.</p>

<p>But, there is diminishing marginal returns after a certain amount of focus on computation, and our education system is long past that point. Furthermore, constantly doing proofs can reduce computation errors as it requires students to think much more deeply and rigorously. If they become comfortable with complex series of steps, surely they&#8217;ll develop the ability to do systematic computations as a byproduct.</p>

<p>Additionally, students have to do computations as intermediate steps in their proofs. If they know what they&#8217;re trying to prove and are not able to do so, it may warrant them reexamining their work and identifying the computation mishap (which is arguably a better teacher than constant repetition).</p>

<p>With the onset of computer programming, the ability for humans to compute is becoming less and less important. Yes, students need to understand how to do so and be able to perform them in a reasonable amount of time. But to do them all extremely quickly with a near-perfect accuracy is unnecessary. Formalizing the problem into a series of steps to solve for any input (as you do with programming) suffices to show understanding.</p>

<p>Given the state of U.S. education, it is improbable that this type of teaching would ever be requested from a federal or state administration. Educators wanting to do so would need to be placed in an ideal scenario: flexibility to develop their own curriculum and students having sufficient knowledge of computation. Also, teachers are often given incentives to teach to standardized tests, so any teacher changing their curriculum to more proof-based would need to be evaluated independently from these tests.</p>

<p>But if teachers are placed in a scenario where these stars align, proofs should be the largest component of their mathematics curriculum. While necessary for analysis, vocabulary and dates are not what English and history are respectively about. Math should be considered in the same light. The subject should be about developing a thought process, not trying to make all students behave as calculators.</p>

<p>Getting computation problems can be extremely gratifying in the short term. It&#8217;s analogous to short dopamine bursts people receive when they see a new e-mail in their inbox.</p>
<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>
<p>There&#8217;s a relatively large debate about this in philosophy of math literature, which I am unfortunately not (yet) acquainted with.</p>
