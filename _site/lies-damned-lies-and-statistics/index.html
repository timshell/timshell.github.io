        <p>With big data and numbers pervading into social science research nowadays, it is becoming increasingly important that we start educating individuals on how to create and interpret statistical inferences. Too many times an author will (perhaps unintentionally) use ambiguous language to suggest a conclusion that does not actually follow from their data.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I read Michelle Alexander&#8217;s <em>The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</em>. This book truly lived up to all the hype and is a must-read for anyone who has ever pondered about mass incarceration and the criminal justice system in the United States today. Alexander lays out her bold conclusion upfront, but she backs up it well in her arguments throughout the book.</p>

<p>My inner statistician, however, did pick up on some questionable uses of data. While these points were very minor compared to the scope of the whole book, they serve as good examples of the potential to misinterpret statistics in current literature.</p>

<p>During one instance, she pointed how &#8220;white youth were actually the <em>most likely</em> of any racial or ethnic group to be guilty of illegal drug possession.&#8221; It is easy to glance over this statement and think that it is straightforward, but her language describing her data is actually ambiguous.</p>

<p>For example, two different interpretations are</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A larger percentage of white youth population possesses illegal drugs compared to the black youth population</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Given that a youth possesses drugs, they have a higher chance of being white than black</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>First glance of the original statement seems to point to (1), but her data could actually represent (2). And, if the latter is the case, the statement is trivial. There are more white youths than black youths in the United States. If drug possession is identically distributed among the races, we expect more illegal drug possessors will be white rather than black due to population demographics.</p>

<p>While I believe Alexander wrote the original statement to support the claim that black youth aren&#8217;t worse than white youth, it can be interpreted at first glance to be arguing that white youth are worse than black youth. It is unclear what she means, and statements of this magnitude need to be rigorously backed up.</p>

<p>Alexander similarly remarks later that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, in New Jersey, whites were almost twice as likely to be found with illegal drugs or contraband as African Americans, and few times as likely to be found with contraband as Latinos. Although whites were more likely to be guilty or carrying drugs, they were far less likely to be viewed as suspicious, resulting in relatively few stops, searches, and arrests of whites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the first half of this statement is as ambiguous as the previous example - it can definitely fall under either interpretation. I believe the point she wishes to make is that there is a discrepancy between actual drug possession and police searching. This conclusion is valid and follows from her presentation of the data. However, again, it is easy for the reader to gather that whites are the worst racial group when it comes to drug usage. There is nothing wrong with that statement if it&#8217;s true, but it is unclear from her language if it is.</p>

<p>Not to completely criticize Alexander, I did applaud her for pointing out one statistical misinterpretation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as half of state prisoners are violet offenders, but that statistic can easily be misinterpreted. Violent offenders tend to get longer prison sentences that nonviolent offenders, and therefore comprise a much larger share of the prison population than they would if they had earlier release dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander highlights that data is not i.i.d. (independently, identically distributed). Rather, each prisoner does not have the same sentence length. Thus, any statistic that aggregates the state of a prison at any one instance is not representative of the prison system because those with longer sentences are overrepresented.</p>

<p>Vague statistical language can imply certain conclusions when they actually mean something different. It is both up to the writer and the reader to be skeptical and closely analyze any such use. Too many times members of the media, especially news organizations, can spin numbers to fit their agenda.</p>

<p>On an ending note, <em>The New Jim Crow</em> is a phenomenal book and has established Alexander as a key civil rights advocate of this decade. The amount of racism in the law enforcement and criminal justice system is at too high of a level. While we have made so much progress over the past fifty years, it is obviously not enough.</p>
