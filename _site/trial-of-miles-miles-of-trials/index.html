        <p>The U.S. has traditionally alternated between two systems: interval-heavy and mileage-heavy.</p>

<p>Interval-heavy training was popularized through the success of Paavo Nurmi and other Finnish distance runners. In this system you run low mileage but at a high-intensity. After all, to race fast, you need to train fast.</p>

<p>In the other camp, Arthur Lydiard led many New Zealand athletes to success with his mileage-heavy philosophy. He advocates for running many long, moderately-paced miles in order to build up a strong aerobic base. Eventually, speed will come<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The systems are not disjoint. The Paavo system has its fair share of mileage buildup, and the Lydiard system definitely incorporates interval training. Practically every competitive distance runner and coach will agree that both types of training are necessary for success. The difference in training programs is their emphasis.</p>

<p>The current trend (at least in American distance running) is the Lydiard system and has been the training philosophy I have followed for the extent of my running &#8220;career&#8221;.</p>

<p>Training plans are relatively straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run six to seven days a week.</li>

<li>One day (usually Sunday) is dedicated to a &#8220;long run&#8221;, which comprises 20% - 25% of weekly mileage</li>

<li>Two to three days are dedicated to workouts, which are high-intensity work (e.g. 10x400m at mile pace with 90 second rest, 5 continuous miles a little slower than race pace, etc.). Usually one is a shorter distance (e.g. 400m) and the other is longer (e.g. 1000m).</li>

<li>For the rest of the days, jog to recover and build mileage.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many variations on this. Some people will take their long runs fast. For others, their easy jogs are not easy (at least by my standards) at all. Different training groups also have different emphases: long run can be the most important workout for some, while others care the most about 1000m repeats. But, the list above are the basis of essentially every program.</p>

<p>Part of the reason there is so much variation is because each runner responds to a different stimulus. Some need high-mileage. Others&#8217; bodies break down at that point.</p>

<p>Just to show how inconsistent this can all be, here is a graph of my weekly running mileage since freshman year of college.</p>
<p align='center'>
  <img align='center' src='/images/mileage.png' width='25%' />
</p>
<p>The dots indicate races I&#8217;ve run. Red means bad, yellow alright, and green is good.</p>

<p>The four drops to zero miles are the one to two week breaks I take after the end of cross country and track seasons. Using these drops, we can break the graph into five curves:</p>

<ol>
<li>Freshman Cross Country</li>

<li>Freshman Indoor Track + Outdoor Track</li>

<li>Sophomore Summer + Cross Country</li>

<li>Sophomore Indoor Track + Outdoor Track</li>

<li>Junior Summer</li>
</ol>

<p>My freshman year was horrendous: one good race, one alright race, six bad races. But, it was followed by a breakout sophomore year. I still don&#8217;t know what caused my huge success The paradox is that mileage and workouts were relatively similar. Sleep and a few other variables were slightly better my sophomore year, but it doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient for a breakout.</p>

<p>One of the questions I ask myself is whether the mileage buildup I had my freshman year, which doubled my high school weekly mileage, resulted in short-term failures but longer-term success. It is my current hypothesis, but again it doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient in itself.</p>

<p>The fifth, unfinished curve represents my current buildup coming into junior year cross country. I have focused on slow mileage building, but I am in significantly worse shape than the same time my sophomore year. It&#8217;s hard to compare because I have not done workouts or races yet, so I may be fine. But if not, it&#8217;s hard to see why the summer coming into my sophomore year was so much more successful than the one coming into my junior year.</p>

<p>Good, bad, and alright races also seem unpredictable. Whether or not I take a down week (i.e. downward sloping on the graph) does not have a definitive effect. That being said, the sample size is so small it&#8217;s hard to make any judgments from it alone.</p>

<p>My whole point for this post is that running is complicated<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>. Success is easily defined: how fast can you run. But, no one has figured out the science behind becoming faster. It takes a combination of mileage and interval training, but to what extent in each direction? Also, there are so many other factors affecting races: weather, mental state, sleep, and luck just to name a few. However, I think these deviations are more prevalent in runners than other sports because of the small sample size of races and that success is based on an individual (see: Law of Large Numbers).</p>

<p>In my <a href='/machine-learning-and-politics'>last post</a>, I discussed the dichotomy between the hedgehog and the fox. For individuals or small training groups, one needs to be a fox and tailor plans to the specific athlete. It&#8217;s important to note that Paavo Nurmi and Arthur Lydiard (the godfathers of the two schools of running) were more fox-ish (I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to say foxy) than we make them out to be.</p>

<p>Hedgehogs, those who believe in big ideas, do indeed have success in the running world. But, it&#8217;s when they have a huge team and just run them through a system. With enough runners, there will be some who emerge as stars. High school running powerhouses are notorious for doing this. However, because the training wasn&#8217;t catered to the individual, their athletes usually fall short of expectations in college.</p>

<p>Given the small dataset of training and its impact on races, no one has determined a set formula to succeed. Perhaps a larger dataset will shed light into the science of the subject. But perhaps there is an art involved, and that&#8217;s what makes it so alluring.</p>

<p>I know of a runner from DI running powerhouse, University of Portland. Despite the fact that he ran 120 miles per week (40 - 50 more than me), our collegiate personal bests in the 5000m are equivalent.</p>
