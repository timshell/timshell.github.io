        <p>Machine learning promises us precise and accurate predictions. From the past movies you’ve seen on Netflix, what will you want to see in the future? Depending on your genetic makeup, what treatment should you take? Based on the current game board in Go, what is the best move to play?</p>

<p>Policymakers are becoming increasingly split on party lines among how to best allocate resources. In <em>Whatever It Takes</em>, Paul Tough describes the age-old question on how to solve the educational achievement gap. Conservatives believe those in the low-income bracket are lazy, while liberals attribute their failures to insufficient government support. The debate on the relationship between education and poverty is ongoing, and as a result, we don’t have a definitive way of using education to end the poverty cycle.</p>

<p>Enter machine learning.</p>

<p>Machine learning may actually be able to determine the cause of the achievement gap. Imagine a longitudinal study that tracks as much student data as possible. I’m talking data ranging from their IQ to the zip code they were born in to the background of their family members.</p>

<p>After we get all this data, unleash learning algorithms on them. We’ll try to predict an attribute like a student&#8217;s test scores or whether they graduate from college. If our learner has a decent accuracy rate, we may have solved the achievement gap. Now, just start with a target student and tweak their characteristics to see what results in higher scores or a better graduation rate. Policymakers will then finally understand what exactly we need to change instead of relying on <em>a priori</em> intuitions.</p>

<p>Now yes, there are many caveats here. First, we need to get an enormous amount of data for this experiment to work. Is it possible to do get enough data that does not violate privacy concerns but is able to sufficiently train the learner? Next, our learner is not guaranteed to be a good predictor. If not, is it because the problem is unsolvable or we don’t have enough data? And perhaps most importantly, even if we train an accurate learner, will policymakers concede if they disagree with it?</p>

<p>These are essential questions to address, but I don’t think they should obscure the bigger picture: machine learning has the potential to greatly reduce partisan gridlock in Congress! Policy aims to solve problems, and it’s often unclear that it actually does. In an ideal world, policy isn’t about rhetoric but rather delivering tangible results. Machine learning may very well be our best shot to figure out what is the right thing to do. If we accept that actual progress is more important than saving face, machine learning will change policy work drastically.</p>

<p>As Nate Silver recounts in <em>The Signal and the Noise</em>, there are hedgehogs and foxes. Hedgehogs, like politicians, believe one theory explains everything. Foxes, on the other hand, believe that there are many variables you must look at. He attributes much of his success<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> with election predictions to his foxlike nature. Machine learning promises to be a fox and analyze the minute details. If trained right, it will understand what variables <em>actually</em> affect problems like the achievement gap and thus give us detailed recommendations on how to end it.</p>

<p>Much of the excitement of machine learning has been with science and software companies. But, governments have a lot to gain by deploying such algorithms on us<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>. Yes, there are privacy issues to be considered. Yes, algorithms probably will not bring closure on issues like abortion and the death penalty. And yes, there will still be debates about how to best implement the proposed solutions. But, it is definitely within our reach to solve problems like the achievement gap. That in itself is enough justification to use machine learning in the policy world.</p>
